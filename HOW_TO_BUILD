To turn the Python code into a Windows .exe file, you must have py2exe installed on your system. Run the command "python setup.py py2exe". It will put the stuff to be installed in the "dist" subdirectory.

Once there is content in the "dist" directory, run the mm_anywhere_installer.nsi NSIS script (using NSIS). This will bundle the contents of the "dist" directory into the installer file named MMAnywhere-installer.exe.
