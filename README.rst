MMAnywhere - Micro-Manager in a Web Browser
===========================================

MMAnywhere is an HTTP front-end for the core of the Micro-Manager project (see http://micro-manager.org). Its browser-based user interface provides some of the same functionality as the basic MM acquisition dialog, but can be run from any web-browser that can connect to the MMAnywhere host. 

A major goal of this project is to provide device-focused servers, and let clients access devices over a network without needing significant configuration.
