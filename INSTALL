Micro-Manager Installation Instructions

Windows - Using the Installer

To get up and running, perform the following steps:
* Download and install 32-bit Windows MicroManager from http://valelab.ucsf.edu/~MM/MMwiki/index.php/Download_Micro-Manager_Latest_Release
* Configure some demo hardware for MicroManager, making note of the configuration file you are using
* Download MMAnywhere-installer.exe from https://github.com/devalbo/mm_anywhere
* Install MMAnywhere (preferably in a user directory, so it doesn't have issues with permissions when saving images)
* In the MMAnywhere installation directory, edit the mm_anywhere.ini file
  - likely, you will only have to change the MM_DIR and SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION entries
* From the Start menu, select Run MMAnywhere, then open a web-browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000/

Mac OSX
* When trying to use Python with Micro-Manager on Mac OSX, I get an error similar to that described here: http://micro-manager.3463995.n2.nabble.com/Python-help-td6519456.html . Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.
